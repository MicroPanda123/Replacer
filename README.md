# Replacer

It's simple js script for greasymonkey/tempermonkey/other monkey, it replaces photos on websites to random ones from list of images.
It's based on addons that do the same.

## Usage
Just add links to images to images list. Then just copy that script into greasemonkey or different userscript manager like that.
